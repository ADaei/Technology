## Makefile combined with depedency and rule

<example 1>
target: targetFile1 targetFile2
<tab>gcc -o createExecuteFile targetFile1 targetFile2

##1. head line could not use space, but only tab
##2. head tail could not use any sapce
##3. comment use #
##4. it could be change to one line as "target: targetFile1 targetFile2 gcc -o object targetFile1 targetFile2"


<example 2: dependency>
myapp: main.o 2.o 3.o
main.o: main.c a.h
2.o: 2.c a.h b.h
3.o: 3.c b.h c.h

##1. <createFile>:<dependency file1> <dependency file2>

<example 3: auto create dependency>
gcc -MMD -MF program.o.d program.c

<example 3: fake item>
.PHONY: clean
clean:
<tab>action...

#1. fake item is to prevent that if there is a file named "clean" without any dependency, action "make clean" will be defined as creating the file "clean", but it had already exist, so clean action will not be process.
