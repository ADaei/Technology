<MMU Oriental>
  Different process could not access memory used by other process.
  ==> Process only use virtual memory instead of physical memory.
  ==> MMU is a hardware to confirm the translation between virtual memory and physical memory is correct.

<Paging>
  Each process has its own page table.

<Swap>
  When RAM run-out but a process should be run, move a process from RAM to swap partition/file and free the RAM for use.
  If a process move back to RAM but its physical memory address change, re-mapping its virtual memory to physical memory to confirm that the process could access the same virtual memory address as before.
